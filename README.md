### Our topic
After a long time under lockdown, we have decided to “get out” of the pertaining subjects and seek a new trend arising, the Olympics. With over 11,500 athletes in attendance and hundreds of thousands of calls for cancellation. We believe this competition provides for interesting information to be looked for, measured, analyzed, cleaned, and conclusions to be made. We can look into athlete characteristics, sports, investment, finance and many more in order to create interactive mapping and charts, as well as tables. 

### Data Set
